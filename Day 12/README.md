# "Guess The Number" game

It is a simple game of guessing the number. Computer chooses a number at random between 1 and 100, 
and user has to choose a difficulty setting. Easy mode gives 10 lives whereas Hard mode gives only 5. 
User has to guess the number within the amount of lives.

After every guess, a message is displayed on whether the guess is bigger or smaller than the computer's choice.
